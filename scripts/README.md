# Automation Scripts

These scripts serve as a way to automate little things for development, testing, debugging, etc. While these scripts were primarily for personal use, I included them just in case someone else finds them helpful.

## Notice
All of these scripts are expecting to be ran from the root of this repository. If they are ran from the scripts/ directory, they may fail or give incorrect output.
